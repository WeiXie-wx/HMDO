# HMDO

HMDO (Hand Manipulation with Deformable Objects) is the first markerless deformable interaction dataset recording interactive motions of the hands and deformable objects. Its main focus is the non-rigid contact deformation of interacting objects. HMDO currently consists of 21600 frames on 12 sequences.

Coming soon!
